## ðŸ§  Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand the requirements** â€” clarify expected output, constraints, and data relationships.  
2. **Design the query** â€” select optimal joins, filters, and aggregations.  
3. **Optimize** â€” rewrite queries to reduce execution time and improve readability.  
4. **Document** â€” add clear comments and explanations for maintainability.

## ðŸ“– How to Use
- Navigate to the **platform folder** you want to explore.  
- Each problem file contains:  
  - **Problem Statement** (as comments or a link to the original source)  
  - **SQL Solution** (formatted and optimized)  
  - **Explanation** of logic and performance considerations  

Example:
```sql
-- Problem: Find customers who purchased more than 5 items in a month
-- Source: LeetCode #XYZ
-- Approach: Use GROUP BY with HAVING to filter aggregated counts

SELECT customer_id
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
